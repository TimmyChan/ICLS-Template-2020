\printbibliography[title={References (use Heading 1)}]


(Note that references are in style “References,” Times or Times New Roman 10 pt text, "full justified" and use a .5 inch "hanging" indent, with no spaces left between entries. Follow APA style. The MOST important thing about the reference style you use is that readers be able to locate the sources you cite! Please be especially clear in the case of references to on-line materials!)

\section{Acknowledgments (use Heading 1)}

If you would like to make acknowledgments in your paper, please do so after the reference section, use Times or Times New Roman 10 pt font, "full justify" your text, and do not indent the first line of the acknowledgments.
